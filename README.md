Step 1: Selecting the Website or Web-application
Selecting a website or Web--application that lists car prices. Ensuring it has a relatively stable structure and is legal to scrape. 

Step 2: Analysing HTML Structure
We can use a tool like Chrome DevTools to inspect the HTML structure of the webpage and identify the elements containing the car details like price, make, model, and year.
Identifying if the website uses JavaScript to load content dynamically, which might require using tools like Selenium.

Step 3: Writing the Scraper
Using Scrapy for creating a spider if the website loads most content statically.
For websites with JavaScript-loaded content, use Selenium to simulate a browser and extract dynamic content.
Implementation of strategies to handle rate-limiting (adding time intervals between requests) and randomized user-agents to avoid blocking is ideal.

Step 4: Incremental Data Loading
Storing the scraped data in a structured format like CSV or JSON.
Identifying keys or IDs that help you determine new records from old ones.
Developing a script to load this data into a data warehouse like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, or a database of your choice.

Step 5: Scheduling
We use Airflow or Cron jobs to schedule the spider to run daily.
Ensuring the scheduling mechanism can retry on failure and log the output for later analysis.

Step 6: Monitoring and Alerting
Setting up logging for success, error, and failure scenarios.
Using tools like Airflowâ€™s monitoring features or AWS CloudWatch (if hosted on AWS) for alerts. Integrating it with SNS or email notifications for immediate alerts.

Step 7: Documentation
Detailing a README file that covers:
The website chosen and its HTML structure.
How the spider is set up and runs.
Scheduling details.
How to monitor the process and respond to failures.# Car-sales-web-scrapping
